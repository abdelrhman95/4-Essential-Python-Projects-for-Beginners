# 4-Essential-Python-Projects-for-Beginners

# The first project you will learn the following:
-Read a dataset and display records from it
-Use your detective’s hat and uncover hidden patterns in data
-Find the relationship between different variables
-Draw insights by visualizing these relationships



# The Second Project:
-Read a dataset and display records from it
-Display the relationship between variables through different periods
-Perform some calculations to create new variables
-Visualize the effect of handwashing on decreasing the number of deaths

# The Third Project: 
1- Read and explore data
2- Understand the relationship between different variables through visualization
3- Carry out *feature selection to determine the variables that are most related to the target output.
4- Build a machine learning model
5- Use metrics, such as accuracy and ROC curve, to evaluate the model’s performance.
6- Save the trained model into a file to be used for future predictions.
