# 4-Essential-Python-Projects-for-Beginners

# The first project you will learn the following (Uber Trips Analysis):
1- Read a dataset and display records from it
2- Use your detective’s hat and uncover hidden patterns in data
3- Find the relationship between different variables
4- Draw insights by visualizing these relationships



# The Second Project (The Discovery of Handwashing):
1- Read a dataset and display records from it
2- Display the relationship between variables through different periods
3- Perform some calculations to create new variables
4- Visualize the effect of handwashing on decreasing the number of deaths

# The Third Project (Predicting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost): 
1- Read and explore data
2- Understand the relationship between different variables through visualization
3- Carry out *feature selection to determine the variables that are most related to the target output.
4- Build a machine learning model
5- Use metrics, such as accuracy and ROC curve, to evaluate the model’s performance.
6- Save the trained model into a file to be used for future predictions.


# The Fourth project (Detecting Fake News) :
1- Read and explore a textual dataset
2- Build a machine learning model with TfidfVectorizer
3- Create a confusion matrix and understand its components
4- Evaluate the model’s accuracy
